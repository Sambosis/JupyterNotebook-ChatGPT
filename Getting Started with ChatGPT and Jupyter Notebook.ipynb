        "1. *Natural language processing (NLP) capabilities*: ChatGPT has advanced NLP capabilities that can help analysts process and understand large amounts of data. This can be especially useful in cyber investigations where vast amounts of unstructured data, such as logs, need to be analyzed.\r\n",

        "2. *Knowledge retrieval*: ChatGPT has been trained on a diverse range of topics and has the ability to quickly retrieve information on various technical and non-technical subjects. This can help analysts get quick answers to their questions, saving time and effort in their investigations.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. *Automation*: ChatGPT can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time and resources for the analyst to focus on more complex tasks. For example, ChatGPT can automate the process of collecting data from multiple sources, performing data analysis, and generating reports.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. *Reproducibility*: Jupyter Notebooks are designed for reproducibility and collaboration, making it easy for analysts to share their work with others and collaborate on investigations. By integrating ChatGPT with Jupyter Notebooks, analysts can take advantage of these features and create more efficient and effective cyber investigations.\r\n",
