        "4. *Reproducibility*: Jupyter Notebooks are designed for reproducibility and collaboration, making it easy for analysts to share their work with others and collaborate on investigations.

The attack exploits improper configuration of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) by allowing attackers to craft a special SAML request to gain access to a targeted web application. This attack is made possible when the web application mistakenly trusts assertions from the attacker, with the attacker using the “golden SAML” credential to authenticate to the application and gain access. The attack could be used to access sensitive data or inject malicious payloads into the web application.\n"
