# JupyterNotebook - ChatGPT
JupyterNotebook - ChatGPT integration

This work is based on previous idea integratin ChatGPT with Microsoft Sentinel via Logic App. More info here: [ChatGPT and Microsoft Sentinel â€” simplify the incident handling process](https://medium.com/@antonio.formato/chatgpt-and-microsoft-sentinel-simplify-the-incident-handling-process-7f1c6a1ed925) 

Basically this example Notebook is aiming to provide interface to ask questions to ChatGPT, helping security analyst to investigate cyber threats.

Please be aware it's just a playground.

Sharing sensitive information with an AI like ChatGPT requires careful consideration of the risks and potential consequences. Organizations need to ensure that they have robust privacy, security, and ethical frameworks in place to protect sensitive information and minimize the potential for harm.
